    <header>
        <!-- 
            We placed the Navbar code from Bootstrap inside the header at the top of all the other elements
            The link: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/navbar/

            We copied the first template (with search box) from Bootstrap then we modified it:

            With Bootstrap, a navigation bar can extend or collapse, depending on the screen size.

            A standard navigation bar is created with the:
            - .navbar class => for nav bar main styles and content
            - .navbar-expand-xl|lg|md|sm => a responsive collapsing class:  
            (stacks the navbar vertically on extra large, large, medium or small screens)

            Choose from:
            These two classes will affect the text color inside the nav:
            - .navbar-light for use with light background colors => This will add a black text color
            - .navbar-dark for dark background colors => This will add a white text color 
                
            Then, customize with .bg-* utilities.
            These .bg-color classes to change the background color of the navbar
            (.bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light)

            the normal combinations:
            - bg-dark => navbar-dark => a white text
            - bg-light => navbar-light => a black text
        -->
        <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
            <!-- 
        The a element is to link to our home page with the company title
        .navbar-brand => .navbar-brand for your company, product, or project name.
        the link is usually changed to be "index.html"
        This class is used to highlight the brand/logo/project name of your page:

            <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Coffee Corner</a>

                With the move to flexbox in v4.x, 
                you can use margin utilities like .mr-auto to force sibling columns away from one another.
                The link: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/grid/#margin-utilities


                Auto Margins:
