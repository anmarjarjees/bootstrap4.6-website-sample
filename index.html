    <title>Bootstrap The Basic and Grid</title>
</head>

    <!-- 
        Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. 
        Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.
        We can center our content horizontally with containers

        Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

        .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
        .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints (Try this one also)
        .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint

        The link: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/overview/#containers

        We can add background classes provided by bootstrap to see it better in the browser:
        Also adding a background color: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/utilities/colors/#background-color
    -->
    <div class="container bg-light">
        <!-- 
        Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. 
        It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid comes together.

        <tr> => div class="row"
                <td></td> => div class="col"
            </tr>

        Rows are wrappers for columns. 
        Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. 
        This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins. 
        This way, all the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side.

        Because maximum is 12 columns, so for example to have two equal size div elements besides each other we can give each one 6-column width,
        or if you want 3 columns you can give each div 4-column width and so on...

        Grid Classes
        The Bootstrap 4 grid system has five classes:

        .col- (extra small devices - screen width less than 576px)
        .col-sm- (small devices - screen width equal to or greater than 576px)
        .col-md- (medium devices - screen width equal to or greater than 768px)
        .col-lg- (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px)
        .col-xl- (xlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px)
        The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.

        Tip: Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same widths for sm and md, you only need to specify sm.

            Below we used col-md-4, 
            based on breakpoints they will stack besides each other
            if the browser window is greater than 768px 
            if we reduced the browser width to less than 768px they will be stacked vertically
            **********************************************************************************
            For small screen devices, we can use col-sm
            Example:
            if we want content1 and content2 to be displayed in one line (horizontally)
            and content3 to be displayed below them we can add the classes:
            - col-sm-6 for the first and the second divs
            - notice that we don't need to add col-sm-12 for the third div as it's the default
            Notice that col-sm works with minimum 576px

            sm => md => lg => xl

          to create "Three Equal Columns" for any screen size
          we can do it by using the class .col
          The following example shows how to create three equal-width columns, 
          on all devices and screen widths: 
        -->
            <div class="col bg-danger">
                Content Div 1

            <div class="col bg-info">
                Content Div 3

        <hr>
        <!-- 
        What happens if the total of the columns is less/more than 12?

        If more than 12 columns are placed within a single row, 
        each group of extra columns will, as one unit, wrap onto a new line as we saw in the example above

        If less than 12 columns are placed, there will have an empty/empty column(s) or a space at the end of the row.
        In such case we can move the content (columns) to the right, or center them
        by using offset class.

        Offset classes:
        Move columns to the right using .offset-md-* classes. 
        These classes increase the left margin of a column by * columns. 

        For example, .offset-md-4 moves .col-md-4 over four columns.

        below we are adding "offset-sm-2" to look centre

        NOTE: 
        Don't forget that offset-sm-2 class will be applied on small screen devices
        and larger/above, 
        so we need to disable (reset) the offset to 0 for medium screen devices and higher/above 
        by adding "offset-md-0"

        You can read more about offset:
        https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/grid/#offsetting-columns

        <h2>Using offset classes</h2>

                - div#2 will take 4 columns
                - div#3 will take 12 columns by default because bootstrap will use this default value

                We want to add the offset of 2 columns ONLY with small screen devices
                offset-sm-2 => this will be applied to small screens and larger
