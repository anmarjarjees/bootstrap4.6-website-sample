Throughout this project, I will add a few "index.htm"l files to add the Bootstrap component gradually, but in the end we will have the final index file.

- index1.html => contains the Bootstrap starting template and examples of using its Grid System
- index2.html => Adding the basic contents (The main website template)
- index3.html => Adding Bootstrap Navbar
- index4.html => Adding Bootstrap Carousels
- index5.html => Adding Bootstrap Modal and other spacing
- index6.html => Adding Bootstrap Form
